The therapeutic effect of this group of drugs is believed to be related to their specific cellular action of selectively inhibiting transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle. The contractile processes of these tissues are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium into the cells through specific ion channels. Felodipine blocks transmembrane influx of calcium through the slow channel without affecting to any significant degree the transmembrane influx of sodium through the fast channel. This results in a reduction of free calcium ions available within cells of the above tissues.,Canada,Plendil(Felodipine),What is the therapeutic effect of Felodipine related to?

"The bioavailability of PLENDIL is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the peak plasma concentration of felodipine (Cmax) is significantly increased by 1.5 to 2 fold when PLENDIL is taken after a high fat or high carbohydrate meal versus fasting.

"In the rat carcinogenicity study discussed above, an increased incidence of benign interstitial cell tumours (Leydig, cell tumours) was found in the testes of the low (26%=13/50), mid (38%=19/49), and high (40%=20/50) dose males when compared to controls (9%=9/100).  It is considered that these tumours have an endocrinological basis in the rat as they can be induced by various experimental interventions that increase the level of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the blood. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown effects of felodipine which indicate that there is an endocrinological mechanism behind the increased incidence of Leydig cell tumours in rats. In human studies felodipine (given as a single doses of 5, 10 or 20 mg to 12 young healthy volunteers and as 10-20 mg daily for 8 weeks followed by 10 mg daily for one week to 10 hypertensive patients) has not revealed effects on testosterone levels.

"Rosuvastatin was shown to be an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase in microsomes isolated from rat and human liver. Like other statins, the inhibition was competitive with HMG-CoA and non-competitive with NADPH. Using a cloned fragment of human HMG-CoA reductase, representing the catalytic domain, the estimated inhibition constant (Ki) for rosuvastatin was 0.1nM. Inhibition of the catalytic domain was also found to be competitive with HMG-CoA and non-competitive with NADPH. Of the metabolites of rosuvastatin that have been detected in humans and animal species, only N-desmethyl rosuvastatin demonstrated notable inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and was found to be 2- to 7-fold less potent than the parent compound.",Canada,Rosuvastatin(Crestor),Rosuvastatin was shown to be an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase in microsomes of which organ
"Using primary preparations of hepatocytes, rosuvastatin was found to inhibit cholesterol synthesis from acetate, with an IC50 about 7-fold lower than the nearest comparator, atorvastatin and 40-fold lower than pravastatin. Rosuvastatin did not inhibit synthesis of cholesterol from mevalonate (the product of HMG-CoA reductase), indicating no effect on the enzymes of the sterol pathway downstream from HMG-CoA reductase.  Compared to a variety of non-hepatic cells including human myoblasts, rosuvastatin was found to be highly selective for action in hepatocytes. Studies of the initial uptake rates of rosuvastatin into rat hepatocytes defined a high affinity component of uptake with a Km of 9 mM. In addition, compared to other statins, rosuvastatin exhibited low rates of metabolism by cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes. The comparatively high potency of effect of rosuvastatin in hepatocytes may result from a combination of high affinity for the enzyme active site, active transport, and low rates of metabolism. The high degree of selectivity for action of the compound in liver cells is consistent with its octanol:water partition and with evidence of active transport into hepatocytes.",Canada,Rosuvastatin(Crestor),Did Rosuvastatin inhibit synthesis of cholesterol from mevalonate

"Symptomatic hypotension has occurred after administration of ZESTRIL, usually after the first or second dose or when the dose was increased. It is more likely to occur in patients who are volume depleted by diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, vomiting, or possibly in patients with renin-dependant renovascular hypertension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). In patients with severe CHF, with or without associated renal insufficiency, excessive hypotension has been observed and may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. Because blood pressure could potentially fall, patients at risk for hypotension should start therapy under very close medical supervision, usually in a hospital. Such patients should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of lisinopril and/or diuretic is increased.
